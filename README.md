Hello, I'm Chris W. Hughes

I'm a physical oceanographer interested in using geodetic techniques (precise measurements of position, gravity, earth orientation, and time)
together with ocean bottom pressure and sea level, to understand and monitor the global ocean circulation, and to understand past, present and future
changes in sea level.

I began programming in BASIC on a ZX Spectrum, learnt Pascal at university before moving to FORTRAN. Currently I mostly use IDL
and MATLAB, and one of these days I will get round to Python (I've done a little bit so far!).
